ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm currently a PhD candidate in Computer Technology at [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://www.bit.edu.cn/), jointly advised by [Prof. Tianfei Zhou](https://www.tfzhou.com/) and [Prof. Ye Yuan](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pid/33/6315-1.html). I received my B.Eng. in Energy and Power Engineering (2021) and M.Eng. in Artificial Intelligence (2024) from Northeastern University (China), where I was advised by Prof. Ye Yuan during my masterâ€™s study. Broadly, my long-term goal is to create embodied AI that thinks, perceives, and interacts with the world in a human-like way, combining perception, reasoning, and purposeful behavior.
